## Confidential Comments to Editors

With a clear motivation and a well-suited empirical analysis, the paper demonstrates its potential. However, there is considerable room for improvement, as noted in my comments to the authors. This is the main reason why I recommend rejection of the paper, and I hope the authors address the main concerns and seek the next opportunity.

## Comments to the Authors

This paper builds on the rich literature of legislative behavior studies by reconciling two intertwined measurements: ideal point estimation and cohesion metrics. The motivation arises from the fact that these two approaches have largely been developed independently, each with its own limitations. On the one hand, ideal point estimation fails to capture the interaction between individual decisions and partisan dynamics. On the other hand, cohesion metrics are sensitive to the nature of the set of votes they aim to measure. To address this issue, the paper proposes a new measurement based on roll-call votes, allowing researchers to quantify both ideological leanings and cohesion. Despite its clear motivation and objective, the paper faces several issues that need to be addressed, particularly in the analytical discussion of the problem and the proposed method.

**Clarification of Problem Statement**
First of all, the paper could clarify the limitations of current approaches in more detail. It mentions that ideal point estimation fails to capture the interaction between individual decisions and partisan dynamics. A natural question arises: why not directly model the interaction between individual decisions and partisan dynamics within the spatial voting model? Without discussing this seemingly straightforward approach and its feasibility, the paper instead proposes a new measurement that quantifies how much a legislator's voting behavior aligns with left- or right-wing groups, and calculates its standard deviation to measure cohesion. In other words, the paper resorts to measuring individual voting behaviors and then post-processes these to measure partisan dynamics. If this approach can indeed address the fundamental issue with ideal point estimation, then post-processing the ideal point estimates to capture partisan dynamics should also be a valid method. For example, one could use posterior samples of parameters from IRT models to estimate the probability that a legislator's vote aligns with the left or right group, and then calculate the standard deviation of these probabilities to measure cohesion. As an illustrative example, suppose right-wing majority voted 1 on roll-call j. Then \Pr(y_{ij} = 1 \mid \{x_i\}_{i=1}^{n}, \alpha_j, \beta_j), the probability that legislator i votes Yea on this roll-call j, can be computed using the posterior means of x_i, \alpha_j, \beta_j from the IRT model (following the notation of Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004). This can be done for all roll-calls. One can then calculate the standard deviation of these probabilities over roll-calls to measure the cohesion of this legislator. This approach is similar to what the proposed method does in that it uses individual measures to calculate cohesion, but it builds directly on ideal point estimation. Additionally, we can visualize a legislator's ideal point on the x-axis and cohesion on the y-axis using this approach, which is similar to the proposed method. This is just one example, but the key point is that the paper should better justify why the proposed method is more suitable than post-processing ideal point estimates and bill parameters for capturing partisan dynamics.

On the other hand, the paper argues that cohesion metrics are sensitive to the nature of the set of votes they aim to measure. Specifically, it mentions that "it is possible that the scores of party unity may be influenced by changes in the legislative agenda or by events accompanying the votes." However, this is not a unique limitation of cohesion metrics. Ideal point estimation is also vulnerable to the same issue, particularly in cases that do not conform to spatial voting theory. For instance, it could be problematic if only procedural votes are used to estimate ideal points. The paper could clarify this point further. I understand that the authors are trying to argue that cohesion metrics are more sensitive to noise (as opposed to signal), and this distinction could be discussed more clearly.

In general, the paper could provide a more in-depth discussion of the key differences between the two approaches and what has hindered their reconciliation. One point that hasn't been emphasized is that the main output of ideal point estimation is an estimated parameter from a statistical model, whereas cohesion metrics correspond to summary statistics. This creates a significant difference, which the paper hints at: ideal point estimation is susceptible to model misspecification, whereas cohesion metrics do not rely on a model at all. On the flip side, ideal point estimation may be more robust to stochastic noise (given a well-fitted model), whereas cohesion metrics can be more sensitive to outliers and other data issues. The paper could elaborate on these distinctions and explain how they have impeded the reconciliation of the two approaches.

Relatedly, the paper may want to highlight that these two approaches focus on different levels of analysis. Ideal point estimation targets individual ideological scores, whereas cohesion metrics provide roll-call (or aggregated) summaries for each group. The paper states that the proposed method primarily operates at the legislator level, without requiring aggregation into parties or blocs. This raises two follow-up questions: (1) Why is a legislator-level measure of cohesion preferable to a party-level measure? (This also relates to the discussion in Section 4.2.) (2) Isn’t it necessary to define the left/right group in the first place anyway? In that sense, some level of aggregation is already required to define the proposed measure. The paper could address these questions to provide a more comprehensive discussion of the issue.

**Further Justification for the Proposed Method**
The proposed method first measures how much a legislator's voting behavior aligns with that of left- or right-wing groups, which primarily captures partisan voting behavior. Here, I use 'partisan' for simplicity, though it is not meant to refer specifically to party labels, but rather to what has been defined as left-wing or right-wing in the measure. Then, the mean and standard deviation of these measures are used to quantify ideological leanings and group cohesion, respectively. The paper claims that this method integrates the two approaches, but it is not clear how this integration is achieved. The proposed method directly measures partisan voting behavior without using a model, whereas ideal points are latent variables carefully constructed through spatial voting theory. This leads to a fundamentally different approach regarding how information is shared across legislators and roll-calls in the model: the former only uses (1) each legislator's votes for roll-call j and (2) the left- and right-wing majority votes for that roll-call, while the latter incorporates (1) and (2) whether other legislators who voted Yea (or Nay) on other roll-calls also voted Yea (or Nay) on this roll-call. In other words, ideal point estimation (and IRT models in general) determines the Yea and Nay positions of roll-call j by sharing information about how other legislators--who have shown left- or right-leaning behavior on other roll-calls--voted, which allows for a more nuanced concept of ideology through the identification of these bill parameters. As a result, there appears to be a discrepancy between the proposed method and ideal point estimation.

The paper shows correlation between the first dimension of the proposed method (mean of u_{ij}) and W-NOMINATE, but it is unclear whether this is due to the fact that, in highly polarized voting environments, ideology and partisan voting behavior are closely aligned. This is particularly relevant given that the correlation is low in Brazil, where there is a high level of political fragmentation. If the authors could provide a validation study showing that the proposed measure and ideological scores are highly correlated in less polarized legislative bodies, it would be more convincing that the first dimension of the proposed method captures ideology, beyond just partisan voting behavior. Additionally, it seems that the proposed method may be sensitive to how the left/right groups are defined. Appendix 1 illustrates how the researcher can divide legislators into left and right groups, but the paper could discuss how different definitions of these groups or different levels of polarization might affect the results.

Lastly, the paper argues that central limit theorem can be applied to u_{ij}, leading it to converge to a normal distribution as the number of legislators or roll-calls approaches infinity (though this is not explicitly stated, and it is unclear what it means for this number to approach infinity). However, this is not necessarily the case, as \nu_{ij} is not a sample mean, nor is u_{ij}, so the central limit theorem does not apply. Therefore, the paper needs to make parametric assumptions to justify Figure 1. 

**Minor Comments**
It would have been beneficial if the paper had included more mathematical expressions and proofs to clarify the differences and relationships between the proposed method and other measures. Additionally, the term 'two-dimensional' may confuse readers familiar with the ideal point estimation literature. At first glance, it might suggest a two-dimensional latent policy space and corresponding ideal points. However, in this context, each dimension refers more to data visualization, where each represents a different statistic (mean and standard deviation) of the same measure.

The statements on Bayesian approaches were generally misleading and unclear. For example, the core contribution of Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004) is that it connects existing ideal point estimation in spatial voting theory to the IRT model through reparameterization of bill parameters. Yet, the paper just states that it "proposes to observe how preferences have been distributed in votes to estimate the relationship between the ideal ideological position for a voting pattern" which is vague in its meaning. Another example is the statement that "Being a fully frequentist method, B-Call can also be used in cases with a poorer amount of data" in the conclusion, but it is unclear what this means since the estimator (or any estimation details) is not formally stated. Moreover, a smaller amount of data would lead to greater uncertainty, regardless of the method used.

Lastly, considering the paper’s main contribution through case studies in the U.S., Brazil, and Chile, which compare individual-level ideology and cohesion, it may be beneficial to reframe and revise the paper as a comparative legislative behavior study, rather than as a methodological paper.

Typos: In abstract, there's a missing "(a)". In lines 15 and 16 of page 4, "y 1" and "y J" should be corrected. In Section 3.1, i"s should be written as i's.

# Rough notes

## Summary
- Reconciling two intertwined approaches, each of which are prone to the following limitations:
  1. Ideal point estimation: fails to capture the interaction between individual decisions and the partisan dynamics
    - If this is the case, can't we directly model it? Otherwise, we can use the ideal point to compute partisan dynamics (which the paper ultimately does)
  2. Cohesion metrics: volatile to the nature of the set of votes they aim to use or measure
    - Authors described the limitation as follows: "it is possible that the scores of party unity may be influenced by changes in the legislative agenda or by events accompanying the votes." However, this is not a unique limitation of cohesion metrics. Ideal point estimation is also susceptible to the same issue, in particular for the cases that does not align with spatial voting theory. For example, it may be problematic if we only use procedural votes to estimate ideal points. I can see that the authors are trying to make a point that cohesion metrics are more sensitive noise (as opposed to signal) and this can be discussed more clearly.
  
  
## Major comments on analytical framework
- Clarification on the measurement challenge / In-depth discussion on the main differences and what has been hampering the reconciliation so far.
  - Is the problem coming from the fact that each approach focuses on different level of analysis? For example, ideal point estimation targets individual ideological scores while the cohesion metrics focus on the roll-call (or its aggregation) level summary for each group. The paper says "mainly at the legislator level without the need for aggregation levels like parties or blocs": follow-up questions are then, (1) why is having a legislator-level measure better than having a party-level measure? (2) however, isn't in the first place we need to define the group of left/right, so in some sense we already have to do some aggregation to define the measure? For (1), 4.2 can be extended.
  - The main output of ideal point estimation is estimated parameter from a statistical model, whereas that of cohesion metrics is a summary statistic. This results in a major difference, where the formal is susceptible to model misspecification, while the latter does not require a model in the first place. This is a flip side of the coin, where the former maybe more robust to stochastic noise (conditioning on a good model fit), while the latter may be more sensitive to outliers and other data issues.
- Better connection to the original questions and the literature
  - Why not directly model the interaction between individual decisions and the partisan dynamics?
  - Comparison with alternative approaches. What's the advantage of the proposed method v. using ideal point estimates to compute related quantities? 

## Major comments on proposed method
- This is in essence a measurement of partisan voting (here, party is not the party label but suppose we have divided into two groups: left and right wing), and two dimensions correspond to mean and standard deviation of those measures. Ideal point can be a latent variable whereas the proposed method is a direct measurement of the partisan voting behavior, so I'm not sure if this really integrates the two approaches.
- This may be the reason why it has high correaltion with W-NOMINATE in U.S. case. (1) sign of first dimension = almost party label (2) voting behavior is highly polarized (partisan voting) -> so it is not necessarily due to the fact that the first dimension captures ideology, but an evidence of partisan voting. I wonder how the Brazil and Chile NOMINATE looks like.
- Relatedly, isn't this sensitive to how we define left/right group? 
- Convergence: $\nu_{ij}$ is not a sample mean (so does $u_{ij}$), so we cannot apply central limit theorem. We need parametric assumption to justify Figure 1. Even if it does, what does it mean to have the number of legislators (or roll-calls) go to infinity?

## Minor comments
- "Two-dimensional" may confuse the readers who are already familiar with the ideal point estimation literature. At a first glance, it may sound like it is refering to two dimensional latent policy space and corresponding ideal points. Here, each dimension is more of a way of data visulization, where each dimension shows different manipulation of the same measure. 
- Statement on Bayesian IRT model is unclear.
- "Being a fully frequentist ...": unclear. First of all, wasn't sure if this statmenet is correct given that estimator (or any estimation details) is not formally stated. Also, poorer amount of data would lead into higher uncertainty, no matter what approach you take.
